e. Use a suitable username â€“ you could use one you have on other research platforms (if it is available) or try a variation on your name. When choosing the email address for your registration, keep in mind if you need access to Zotero after changing jobs or graduating. Zotero allows you to store an additional email address, too, in case you loose access to your primary registration email. Don't forget to take a look at the Terms of Service!
f. Click the blue button `Register`once you have entered all necessary information.
*! Check what happens afterwards !*
g. Once you are registered (or later: logged in), Zotero welcomes you with a landing page like this

h. We want to run Zotero on our own machines, so lets click on the big red button in the middle that says `Download`!
i. Zotero will automatically identify your Operating System (OS) and propose the latest stable version for you to download. If you are unsure if this is the correct OS or you want an earlier version of Zotero, you can manually select the OS or version 4.0 of Zotero. (Zotero supports standalone versions for all common platforms like Mac, Windows as well as Linux.)
j. Is the correct version and OS selected, click on the blue `Download`button. The download will start automatically.
k. Navigate to where the file was downloaded to. This might be your Downloads-folder or another location. If you are unsure, you can use the Search function and type "Zotero". (On Mac click on the magnifying glass symbol in the upper right corner. On Windows, open the file explorer and type in the search bar.)
l. Once you have found the file, double-click on it to unpack.
