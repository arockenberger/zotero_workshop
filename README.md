# Zotero Workshop

Workshop in development. Will be threefold:

## Beginners

download, install, browser version, make a user account, settings for
library and group library, what Zotero is (and isn't), managing references for research and other projects, using Zotero as 
a database for research literature, research objects etc. Integrating Zotero with a word processor (MS Word, OpenOffice, 
LibreOffice, GoogleDocs). "Picking" references with your web browser, using library catalogues, amazon, google books;
using paper repositories like Zenodo, Arxiv etc. Cleaning your data, adding full text pdfs automatically and manually;
structuring your Zotero project library with tags and collections. Searching and querying Zotero. Making notes in Zotero; 
importing references from other programs (Endnote, BibTex etc.) into Zotero; exporting references from Zotero; best practices 
in using a reference manager in your daily research work, developing good habits, setting aside time for keeping and maintaining
good quality of data

## Intermediate

Customized workshop for projects or individuals who want to make the most out of using a reference management system and bibliographical
database; are either already used to working with Zotero or similar programs, don't need very basic introduction; integration
with other research tools (word processors etc.); basic analytics and visualisations for data exploration with Zotero (timeline
etc.); advanced tags and collections, automated queries; full text search

## Advanced

Looking at specific tools for advanced use of Zotero; look at the community contributions page on website with overview of 
plugins, add-ons etc.; help setting up; data to be analysed must already be cleaned and in order, research question etc. must 
be in place for workshop to work; can be combined with intermediate workshop, depending on the tools and the comfort level of 
workshop participants;
